Illidan bounded forward to confront Magtheridon himself.
The pit lord’s huge glaive crashed down, biting into the stone where Illidan had stood.
He was already away, rolling between the lord of Outland’s columnar legs, hamstringing each of the front ones with a double swipe of his blades.
The pit lord roared with fury and struck again. Illidan tumbled forward under his foe’s belly, drawing forth ichor with his strikes.
He vaulted onto Magtheridon’s massive tail, ran up his spine, and drove his blades into the demon’s thick neck.
